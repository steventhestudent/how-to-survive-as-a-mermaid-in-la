## How to survive as a mermaid in LA

### Addressing the Elephant in the Room
Since the days of Atlantis, we merfolk have chosen to keep our distance from humans. However, with the increasing destruction of our habitats, many of us now find ourselves forced to surface more frequently. This guide will help you navigate LA, to remind you that you can still thrive.

### stick to large, private, aquatic spaces
preference for aquatic spaces because what if u need to get away!? good luck finding me in the water!
avoid chlorinated, it may sound nice, but your gills will thank you!

### Be a role model
it is imperative to clean the environment so don't litter, litter bugs, that's treasonous. encourage good behavior towards society by humans at all times. engage with our environmental group (secret-mermaid-society in disguise) (which we actually understand the urgency unlike humans).

### try not to think about it
ur young ur beautiful, lifes great, but now u have a tail, chill out at a spot. drink responsibly, beverages less than 60% water. enjoy yourself YOLO.

### take cover
coming out of the beach? Towels towels towels! Bring a large umbrella to avoid being sighted aerially, and a couple towels while the tail subsides. Sunglasses keep anonymous too.

### conclusion
times are tough, but it's important to remind yourself you're just one merperson, and you shouldn't take life too seriously. take it with a grain of salt, etc. and please, be discreet!
