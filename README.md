## How to survive as a mermaid in LA

### Addressing the Elephant in the Room
Since the days of Atlantis, we merfolk have chosen to keep our distance from humans. However, with the increasing destruction of our habitats, many of us now find ourselves forced to surface more frequently. This guide will help you navigate LA, to remind you that you can still thrive.

### Stick to Large, Private, Aquatic Spaces
Always have a preference for aquatic spaces—you never know when you’ll need a quick getaway! Good luck finding me in the water! Avoid chlorinated pools; they may sound tempting, but your gills will thank you for staying away.

### Be a Role Model
It is imperative to protect the environment—so no littering! Littering is treasonous. Be a role model and encourage good behavior among humans. Engage with our environmental group (the secret-mermaid-society in disguise), because unlike humans, we actually understand the urgency.

### Don't forget to take Time to Relax
Don't stress! You're young, you're beautiful, and life is great --even with a tail. Find a quiet spot to relax and enjoy the moment.

### Take Cover
Coming out of the ocean? Towels, towels, towels! Bring a large umbrella to avoid being spotted from above and have a couple of towels handy while your tail subsides. Sunglasses also help keep you anonymous.

### Conclusion
Times are tough, but remember, you're just one merperson, and life doesn't need to be taken too seriously. Take it all with a grain of salt, stay discreet, and enjoy the ride.
